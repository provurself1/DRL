Taxi dispatching in urban environments is a complex and dynamic challenge due to the fluctuating nature of demand, traffic conditions, and taxi availability. Traditional heuristic-based methods often fall short of optimizing resource allocation, leading to inefficiencies such as longer passenger wait times and increased fuel consumption. In this study, we propose the use of Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a reinforcement learning algorithm, to develop an AI-based taxi dispatching system. By simulating an urban environment, we train the DQN agent to optimize taxi routes and dispatching decisions, with the goal of minimizing idle times and maximizing driver earnings. The environment includes realistic factors such as transit times, ride durations, and demand fluctuations, making it a suitable platform for evaluating the model's performance. Results indicate that the DQN agent improves the efficiency of taxi services, enhances customer satisfaction by reducing wait times, and increases driver utilization rates, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning in real-world transportation systems.
